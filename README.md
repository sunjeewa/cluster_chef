# ClusterChef is now Ironfan

Please visit the [ironfan repo](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan) instead. All current work, issues and wiki pages have been migrated.

We have however left the obsolete versions in place in this repo:

* The [version_2](https://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef/tree/version_2) branch holds cluster_chef version 2 (before the new discovery system).
* The [version_3](https://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef/tree/version_3) branch holds cluster_chef version 3 before the rename and launch.

Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience.
